            <h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
            <p>
                The settings provided in this section offer a more detailed level of control over the text generation
                process. It is important to be careful when making changes to these settings without proper
                consideration, as doing so may result in degraded quality of responses.
            </p>
            <h3>Top P Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                This setting controls how much of the text generated is based on the most likely options.
                The top P words with the highest probabilities are considered. A word is then chosen at random, with a
                higher chance of selecting words with higher probabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set value to 1 to disable its effect.
            </p>
            <h3>Top K Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                This setting limits the number of words to choose from to the top K most likely options. Can be used
                together with Top P sampling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set value to 0 to disable its effect.
            </p>
            <h3>Top A Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                This setting allows for a more flexible version of sampling, where the number of words chosen from
                the most likely options is automatically determined based on the likelihood distribution of the options,
                but instead of choosing the top P or K words, it chooses all words with probabilities above a certain
                threshold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set value to 0 to disable its effect.
            </p>
            <h3>Typical Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                This setting selects words randomly from the list of possible words, with each word having an equal
                chance of being selected. This method can produce text that is more diverse but may also be less
                coherent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set value to 1 to disable its effect.
            </p>
            <h3>Tail Free Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                This setting removes the least probable words from consideration during text generation, which can
                improve the quality and coherence of the generated text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set value to 1 to disable its effect.
            </p>
            <h3>Repetition Penalty Slope</h3>
            <p>
                If both this and Repetition Penalty Range are above 0, then repetition penalty will have more effect
                closer to the end of the prompt. The higher the value, the stronger the effect.
            </p>
            <p>Set value to 1 for linear interpolation or 0 to disable interpolation.</p>
