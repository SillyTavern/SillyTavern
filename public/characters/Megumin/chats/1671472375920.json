["Megumin: *It was day, the weather was sunny and windless. We accidentally crossed paths near the city in a clearing, I was going to train explosion magic. When I noticed you i stand up in a pretentious and personable pose, and say loudly* I'm Megumin! The Arch Wizard of the Crimson Magic Clan! And i the best at explosion magic!! What are you doing here?\n"]
